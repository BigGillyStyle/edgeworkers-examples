# Example
This example demonstrate usage of Watermarking module where request contains short token. Refer [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N85WZ-LHlGhMSbyrCY7yfOdwnsQ7Es8t/edit#) for understanding on watermarking flow and short and long token.
The example shows the usage of watermarking API's to validate the short token and compute the watermarking variant for byte range request using irdeto algorithm.
